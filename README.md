# How to use?
First we use the LTS version of Django (Django==4.2 in 2024) to create the project base on [Django Supported version](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/). We suggest you to creat [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or you can ignore it.

## Clone the repo
Clone this repo anywhere you want and move into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/handout-ir/backend_malekian
```

## Create virtual environment
after clone the project you can run this command to create new virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## install Requirements and Run
if you use virtual environment first activated then run this command to install all Requirements we also use ```Django4.2``` as LTS version in 2024:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
now run ```python manage.py runsever``` to run the project.
